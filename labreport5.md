Hi! I was running my grading script, and for some reason, I have a test that's always failing.

I've tried tweaking some of my code, but I can't get it to work. I think it might be an issue with how my tests could be set up, but I'm not entirely sure. I think it could be possible that in my test file, there could be a typo or something that is stopping my test from properly running.

Hey Diego, have you tried looking at the variables stored? Since you've only really provided us with the image of your input and output, rather than the code itself, the most we can do to help you is a few general debugging solutions. Try running `javac -g` and `jdb`, this could show you what the current variables are.
